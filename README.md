## üí° Quick Tip: Clear all input fields easily

When practicing on NetPractice (or similar web tools with many input fields), you can quickly clear all text entries without refreshing the page.

Just open the developer console (`F12` ‚Üí "Console" tab) and run:

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('input[type="text"]').forEach(input => input.value = '');
```
This will instantly empty all text input fields on the page!
